GuildNotificator is an Addon Which displays a simple notification when a guildmate login and logout

It also includes several options to be less intrusive and more customizable than other guild notifiers.

    First, you can activate notifications per guild
    Then, each guild message can be colorized, and per default guild color is your guild chat color
    Plus, if a guildmate and you share 2+ guilds, only a single message is displayed to avoid flood
    And also, if you and your guildmate are friends, a single message is displayed
    And of course, the mesage is in your language
    Finally, Notifications are show on 1st tab OR in each tab the guild chat is displayed
